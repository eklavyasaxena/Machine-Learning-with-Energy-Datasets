# Case: Machine Learning with Energy datasets

## Summary
As interest in IOT and sensors pick up steam, companies are trying to build algorithms and systems to
understand consumer behavior to help them make better decisions. One such application is energy
modeling. Though, most consumers are aware of their aggregate consumption of energy, few are aware
of how and where energy is consumed. With increasing sensors in equipment, it is becoming easier to find
out which equipment/instruments consume the most power. It will be interesting to understand consumer energy
usage and the attributes that contribute to appliance energy usage. With the knowledge of energy consumed by
various equipment, seasonality and attributes like temperature and humidity, a machine learning model could 
be used to predict aggregate energy use
